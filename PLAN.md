### [x] L. `REST/ApiDoc.php` — Complete API doc for all OZone built-in services

**Current behaviour:** `ApiDoc::loadProviders()` iterates over route providers and calls `apiDoc()` only on
those that implement `ApiDocProviderInterface`. Several built-in services have stale, missing, or incomplete
`apiDoc()` implementations — e.g. `SignUp` still hardcodes the request body instead of auto-detecting it
from the registered route's declared form.

**Proposed solution:**
Implement or update `ApiDocProviderInterface::apiDoc()` on every built-in service/view that exposes a public
HTTP API: auth routes (login, logout, password, sign-up), file serving, auth link, API doc spec, QR code, etc.

- Where a route has a declared form, call `requestBodyFromForm()` (already implemented) so the OpenAPI body
  is always derived from the live form definition — no manual field lists.
- `requestBodyFromForm()` must use `toHumanReadable()` as the fallback field label/description when
  `field.label` / `api.doc.description` metadata is absent.
- Where `addOperationFromRoute()` can be called directly (route name is known), use it.
- Audit every existing `apiDoc()` for stale request bodies or parameters that can be auto-derived and replace them.
- Ensure the CSRF endpoint and any other service that currently has no `apiDoc()` is covered.

**Complexity:** Low | **Risk:** None (purely additive — doc generation only)

### [x] E. `Services/QRCode.php` — QR code generation

**Current behaviour:** QR generation is commented out; the route returns an empty PNG body.

**Proposed solution:**
Add `endroid/qr-code` (pure PHP, no `ext-imagick` required) to `composer.json` and generate the
PNG in-memory, writing it to the `$file` tmpfile handle already created. Alternatively, use a
bundled pure-PHP QR encoder to avoid adding a dependency. **Confirm preferred approach before proceeding.**

**Complexity:** Low | **Risk:** Low-Medium (dependency question pending; isolated service)

### [x] 0. Expand integration test suite

**Goal:** Full integration test coverage before adding new features or fixing bugs. Tests exercise real CLI
subprocesses against temporary scaffolded projects so regressions are caught end-to-end.

**Status: COMPLETE — 939 tests, 1730 assertions, all passing (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL).**

**Done:**

### [ ] K. `Auth/Auth2FA.php` — Implement two-factor authentication flow

**Current behaviour:** `check2FAAuthProcess()` throws `RuntimeException('User 2FA not yet implemented.')`.

**Proposed solution (outline — full design needs separate discussion):**

1. After successful credential verification, if `$user->has2FAEnabled()`, start an OZAuth authorization flow
   using a new `TwoFactorAuthorizationProvider` (sends code via email or TOTP app).
2. Attach the partially-authenticated state to the session (user ID + awaiting-2FA flag) without fully logging in.
3. The login response returns a `202 Accepted` with the `OZAuth` ref instead of a session token.
4. The client completes the flow via `POST /auth/:ref/authorize` (existing auth endpoint).
5. On successful authorization the provider attaches the user to the auth method and fires `AuthUserLoggedIn`.

> **Note:** This is a significant feature. Approve the outline before we design the implementation in detail.

**Complexity:** High | **Risk:** High (security-critical auth flow)
